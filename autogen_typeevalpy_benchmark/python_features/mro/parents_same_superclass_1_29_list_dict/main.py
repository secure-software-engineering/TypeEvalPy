# This tests the simple rule of MRO: Most specific first.

# MRO appends the superclasses of the parents in the inheritance chain. So the inheritance chain should look like this: D -> B -> A -> object -> C -> A -> object
# However, since A and object appear later in the chain, that means that more specific versions exist, so the correct inheritance chain is: D -> B -> C -> A -> object
